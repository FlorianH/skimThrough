-- What? --

The jQuery skimThrough plugin lets you create a simple image gallery to enable your users to skim through a set of images very quickly. When the user moves his/her cursor horizontally over his/her browser window, one of the images will be displayed.

You can have a look at the demo: http://florianherlings.de/files/skimthrough/

-- How? --

To use the library, just use the provided html file as a template OR: create a new div container, that holds your set of images:

  <div id="container">
    <img src="img_01.jpg" alt="" />
    <img src="img_02.jpg" alt="" />
    <img src="img_03.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>


Make sure, that you add the css codes to your css file:

  .bg       { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; }
  .bgwidth  { width: 100%; }
  .bgheight { height: 100%; }


After that, you just include jquery and the skimThrough plugin:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="skimThrough.js"></script>


Last step is to activate the plugin:

  <script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {

      $('#container').skimThrough();

    });
  </script>


-- Configuration --

The plugin has two configuration options: The duration of animation and the container that will hold the information about the currently displayed image. Both are optional.

  $('#container').skimThrough({
    'duration': 500,
    'counter_element': '#current_page'
  });
